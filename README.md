A web app to explore opportunities to reduce hospital care via Types of Potentially-Mitigatable Activity (TPMAs).

The app is [deployed openly to Posit Connect](https://connect.strategyunitwm.nhs.uk/tpma-explorer/) with no access requirements.
Developers can also access [a development version](https://connect.strategyunitwm.nhs.uk/tpma-explorer-dev/) of the app.

## For developers

This section is aimed at maintainers of the tool who work for The Strategy Unit Data Science team.

### Run and deploy

The app is made with [Shiny](https://shiny.posit.co/) and is an R package following [the nolem approach](https://github.com/StatsRhian/nolem).

To develop the app, you must first:

* create an `.Renviron` file from the `.Renviron.example` template (restart R after making changes to this file)
* run `pak::pak()` to install required and developmental dependencies from the `DESCRIPTION`
* [install Air](https://posit-dev.github.io/air/), which is used for formatting the code
* [install Jarl](https://jarl.etiennebacher.com/), which is used for linting the code

To launch the app locally for development purposes, run `source("app.R")`.

Before submitting a pull request, run locally:

* an R-CMD check, e.g. from the R console with `devtools::check()`
* the test suite, e.g. from the R console with `testthat::test()`, noting that you must reach 100% test coverage
* a format check, e.g. in your terminal with `air format .`
* a lint check, e.g. in your terminal with `jarl check .`

When ready to deploy to Posit Connect, step through the `dev/deploy.R` script.
Note that you should deploy to the 'dev' deployment following pull-requests, or to 'prod' following a release.

### Data

#### Location

Underlying data is generated via the NHP inputs-data pipeline in [the nhp_data repository](https://github.com/The-Strategy-Unit/nhp_data/) and is read into the app from the parquet files in the relevant Azure container (named in the `AZ_CONTAINER_INPUTS` environment variable).

#### Version

The version of the data fetched by the app is controlled by the `DATA_VERSION` environment variable.
The value should be `dev` for local development and for the dev deployment.
The production deployment should set this value to the latest version of the data in the form 'v5.2'.

#### Re-fetch data

Note that the inputs-data parquet files are downloaded to the `app_data/` folder when you `run_app()`.

Locally, you can force-redownload the data by (a) deleting `app_data/` and re-sourcing `app.R`, or (b) by running `get_all_data()` with the argument `redownload = TRUE`.

On the server, authorised devs can invalidate the current data cache by appending `?reset_cache=true` to the apps' canonical URLs (i.e. `https://connect.strategyunitwm.nhs.uk/tpma-explorer` and `/tpma-explorer-dev`).
The data will be re-fetched the next time the app starts up.

### File structure

In:

* `app_data/` you can find data downloaded from Azure (if `run_app()` has been run at least once)
* `data-raw/` you can can find code used to generate lookups in `inst/app/reference/`
* `dev/` you can find the `deploy.R` script to deploy to Posit Connect
* `inst/` you can find:
    * `golem-config.yaml`, which contains configuration (copied originally from [nhp_inputs](https://github.com/The-Strategy-Unit/nhp_inputs/blob/main/inst/golem-config.yml))
    * lookup data files in `app/reference/`
    * Markdown files under `app/text/`, which contain body and tooltip text
* `R/` you can find:
    * Shiny modules (server and UI components) that are stored in `mod_*.R` scripts
    * functions to help prepare data in `utils_*.R` scripts
    * logic for user facing outputs (plots, tables) in `fct_*.R` scripts
